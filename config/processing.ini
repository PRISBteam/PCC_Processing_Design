; Processing modes:
; 'R' --> is for Random, 'S' --> is for reading k-sequence from a source file, 'F' --> is for maximum configuration entropy (S-max), 'D' --> is for minimum configuration entropy (S-min)
; 'L' is for log-normal (mu, sigma parameters) strips distribution
; 'Cr' --> crystallographic Random, 'Cm' --> crystallographic S-max
; 'I' is for index mode with a specific index_value,
; 'Km' --> is for 'kinematic' fracture mode, 'Kn' --> is for 'kinetic' fracture mode.
